# Unit 1: An electronic hardware store

## Criteria A: Planning

### Context of the problem
There is a hardware store in Karuizawa. This store is quite old and 1000 years old. The owner, Mr Sakamoto, wants to upgrade his accounting software, which at the moment is kept on paper. He would like to have a software application that replaces his accounting book. Mr Sakamoto got a MAC PC from his newphew and he likes to use it.

### Justification of the problem
***Here we will design the statement, what will we do, how, by when***

We want to design a text based application that runs on a computer, which provides the functionality for the hardware store. The app should provides the functionality for the hardware record of purchases, categorization of items, record of inventory, calculation of totals, billing. We will develop this application using Python because it is the programming language we are learning in class. In comparison to C++ or C, Python has a lean and simple programming syntax. In addition, Python has become the most popular programming language over the last year [1]. Similary, Python has a large repository of libraries and documentation.

T.E.L.O.S study:
Technology (Is the project technically possible?), Economics (Can the project be afforded? Will it increase profit?), Legal(Is the project legal?), Operational(How will the current operations support the change?), Scheduling(Can the project be done in time?)

## Criteria for success
1. Provides clear feedback to the user (Usability)
2. **There are no bugs in the application**
3. The application should allow to caculate the total and billing
4. Secure application: it allows user login/authorization

-First test of text based menu:
```.py

print("Computer Shop Menu")
print("="*20)
print("1.RAM: 50$")
print("2.CPU: 80$")
print("3.Motherboard: 40$")
print("4.GPU: 60$")
print("")
print("Choose your option:")
RAM_num = input("Number of RAM I want to order:")

Motherboard_num = input("Number of Motherboard I want to order:")
GPU_num = input("Number of GPU I want to order:")
print("")
print("="*20)
print("Your order is:")
print("Number of RAM you ordered:{},Number of CPU you ordered:{}, Number of Motherboard you ordered:{},Number of GPU you ordered:{}".format(RAM_num,CPU_num,Motherboard_num, GPU_num))

print("="*20)
def printItem(Computer_items, leftWidth, rightWidth):
    for k, v in Computer_items.items():
        print(k.ljust(leftWidth, '.') + str(v).rjust(rightWidth)+"$")

print("")
print("Total Cost:({}+{}+{}+{})$".format(RAM_cost, CPU_cost, Motherboard_cost, GPU_cost))
print("or {}$".format(Total_cost))

```
-Fourth test (using variables in the dictionary instead of writing out the price again):
```.py
print("Computer Shop Menu")
print("="*20)

print("")
print("="*20)
print("Your order is:")
print("Number of RAM you ordered:{},Number of CPU you ordered:{}, Number of Motherboard you ordered:{},Number of GPU you ordered:{}".format(RAM_num,CPU_num,Motherboard_num, GPU_num))
RAM_cost = (int(RAM_num) * Computer_items["RAM"])
CPU_cost = (int(CPU_num) * Computer_items["CPU"])
Motherboard_cost = (int(Motherboard_num) * Computer_items["Motherboard"])
GPU_cost = (int(GPU_num) * Computer_items["GPU"])
Total_cost = int(RAM_cost+CPU_cost+Motherboard_cost+GPU_cost)
print("")
print("Total Cost:({}+{}+{}+{})$".format(RAM_cost, CPU_cost, Motherboard_cost, GPU_cost))
print("or {}$".format(Total_cost))

3.Tax calculator:

-Version 1 (without pattern regconition):
```.py
#Tax Caculation
rate = 0
bill = int(input("Please input the customer's bill (BTC):"))

while True:
    if bill<0:
        print("The bill cannot be negative. Try again")
    if bill == 0:
        print("The bill is 0BTC. Try again")
    else:
        break
#Without using pattern recognition:
if bill > 1000:
    rate = 5
if 750 < bill <= 1000:
    rate = 10
if 500 < bill <= 750:
    rate = 15
if 250 < bill <= 500:
    rate = 20
if 0 < bill <= 250:
    rate = 25

tax_included_bill = int(bill * ((100+rate)/100))
print("The customer tax rate is {}% of the bill and his tax included bill is {} BTC".format(rate,tax_included_bill))

```
-Version 2 (with pattern regconition and decoration of prints):
```.py
#Tax Caculation
rate = 0
bill = int(input("Please input the customer's bill (BTC):"))

while True:
    if bill<0:
        print("The bill cannot be negative. Try again")
    if bill == 0:
        print("The bill is 0BTC. Try again")
    else:
        break

#Using pattern recognition (this is because of the same increase in price over 250:250,500,750,1000):
for n in[0,1,2,3,4]:
    if 250*n <bill <=250*n+250:
        rate = 0.25-0.05 * n  #0.05 is the smallest 5% tax and 0.25 is the highest tax, as n increase (which is the bill increasing), the tax will decrease)
    if bill > 1000:
        rate = 0.05


tax_included_bill = int(bill + bill*rate)
print("The customer tax rate is {}% of the bill and his tax included bill is {} BTC".format(rate,tax_included_bill))



for n in range(50):
    print("*", end = '')

print("\n              Bill+Tax= {} BTC".format(tax_included_bill))
for n in range(50):
    print("*", end = '')


```
-Version 3 (with better printing decoration/similar with the decoration of the task given):
```.py
#Tax Caculation
rate = 0
bill = int(input("Please input the customer's bill (BTC):"))

while True:
    if bill<0:
        print("The bill cannot be negative. Try again")
    if bill == 0:
        print("The bill is 0BTC. Try again")
    else:

    if bill > 1000:
        rate = 0.05


tax_included_bill = int(bill + bill*rate)
print("The customer tax rate is {}% of the bill and his tax included bill is {} BTC".format(rate,tax_included_bill))



def print_frame(b, c):
    print(c * b)
    print(c, ' ' * (b - 2), c, sep='')
    print(c, ' ' *15  , "Bill+Tax= {} BTC".format(tax_included_bill), ' ' *16 , c, sep='')
    print(c, ' ' * (b- 2), c, sep='')
    print(c * b)

print_frame(50,'*')

4.Perfect number identification simulation:
-Version 1:
```.py
number = int(input("Input your number:"))

# % get the factors
factor = 0
sum_factor = 0



# for x in range(number-1,1,-1):
#     if number % x == 0:
#         sum_factor += x

for x in range(2,number-1):
    if number % x == 0:
        sum_factor += x

if number == sum_factor+1:
    print("This is a perfect number")
else:
    print("This isn't a perfect number")

```
-Version 2:
```.py
number = int(input("Input your number:"))

# % get the factors
factor = 0
sum_factor = 0



# for x in range(number-1,1,-1):
#     if number % x == 0:
#         sum_factor += x

for x in range(2,number-1):
    if number % x == 0:
        sum_factor += x

if number == sum_factor+1:
    print("{} is a perfect number".format(number))
else:
    print("{} isn't a perfect number".format(number))

```
-Version 2(print all perfect numbers in a range of numbers that the user provide/still give out non-perfect number like 24):
```.py
print("You will input the range of number to find how many perfect numbers are in this range.")
start_number = int(input("Input your starting number:"))
end_number = int(input("Input your ending number:"))



def Check_Perfect(start_number, end_number):
    for i in range(start_number, end_number+1):
        sum_factor = 0
        for x in range(1, i):
            # Check if a divisor
            if i % x == 0:
                sum_factor+=x
                if i == sum_factor:
                    print(i)

Check_Perfect(start_number, end_number)

```
-Version 3 (Works perfectly):
```.py
print("You will input the range of number to find how many perfect numbers are in this range.")
start_number = int(input("Input your starting number:"))
end_number = int(input("Input your ending number:"))



def Check_Perfect(start_number, end_number):
    for i in range(start_number, end_number+1):
        sum_factor = 0
        for x in range(1, i):
            # Check if a divisor
            if i % x == 0:
                sum_factor+=x
        if i == sum_factor:
                    print(i)

Check_Perfect(start_number, end_number)

```
